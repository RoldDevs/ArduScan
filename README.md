Arduino-Based Smart Verification Scanner

## Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following libraries for seamless hardware and software integration:

1. **[Adafruit_Fingerprint_Sensor_Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Fingerprint-Sensor-Library)**  
   Enables the use of fingerprint sensors to authenticate users.

2. **[LiquidCrystal_I2C](https://github.com/johnrickman/LiquidCrystal_I2C)**  
   Facilitates communication with LCD displays via the I2C protocol.

3. **[Keypad](https://github.com/Chris--A/Keypad)**  
   Provides support for matrix-style keypads for secure user input.

4. **[Adafruit_ST7735_and_ST7789_Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-ST7735-Library)**  
   Enables communication with ST7735/ST7789-based TFT displays.
